# Define is_divisible function here
#Problem statement: Write a method is divisible that takes two integers, m and n. The method returns True if m is divisible by n, and returns False otherwise. Test cases for this function are included for you; look at the conditions that they test and try to make sure your future test cases are comprehensive.
##### YOUR CODE HERE #####

#request input of variables
m = raw_input("Enter a number. ")
n = raw_input("Enter another number. ")

#determine if n is divisible by n
remainder = m % n
if remainder  == 0:
    print "True"
#else remainder != 0:
else:
    print "False"



#2. Imagine that Python doesnâ€™t have the != operator built in. Write a method not equal that takes two parameters and gives the same result as the != operator. Obviously, you cannot use != within your function! Test if your code works by thinking of examples and making sure the output is the same for your new method as != gives you.



# Test cases for is_divisible
## Provided for you... uncomment when you're done defining your function

#print is_divisible(10, 5)  # This should return True
#print is_divisible(18, 7)  # This should return False
#print is_divisible(42, 0)  # What should this return?
